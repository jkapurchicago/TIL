## Summary of Git 
Today I learned how to use Git Bash. Git makes a local repository on your computer. It takes snapshots of your files. 
You decide when to make a snapshot when making a **commit.** You can visit any snapshot at any time. You can stage files before committing. 

## Summary of Github
